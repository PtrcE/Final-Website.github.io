  <h4>Training Your Dog</h4>

  <div class="text-page">
    <!--i used this div class for majority of my pages contents to ensure that all are at the same style -->
    <p>How does your dog learn?

      Everyone wants a puppy that is polite, content, and sociable, but you can only expect him to give you what he
      needs.
      Thus, it is crucial to begin training as soon as possible. In fact, training may have begun before you picked up
      your puppy; your dog may have had basic obedience training as well as toilet training.
      Now it's up to you.
      <br> <br>
      It's crucial that your puppy picks up good manners immediately away because he will pick things up very quickly.
      Although it may seem obvious, your puppy cannot learn without instruction, therefore you must begin teaching him
      manners right away.
      <br> <br>

      <img class="infopic1" src="../Media/factsdogs.jpeg">

      There are numerous approaches to training, but there are a few golden rules that everyone must follow to:
      <br> <br>
      Dogs learn by association, so when your puppy behaves well, praise him.
      The likelihood of the action being repeated increases then.
      However, the reward must be connected to the activity, therefore it must come quickly‚Äîwithin a second or two‚Äîafter
      the deed.
      The reward itself may take the form of food, praise, or even a game.
      <br> <br>
      Have five or six sessions a day, each lasting not longer than two minutes.
      To give your puppy the best chance of comprehending your commands, train him in a variety of settings, including
      the house, outside, and on walks.
      Just make sure there are no distractions.
      <br> <br>
      Not so good boy: It's important to teach your puppy what he can and cannot do.
      He won't be able to tell what he can or cannot chew because, for instance, chewing is a part of his exploratory
      behavior.
      Even while you should disregard such inappropriate behavior, you shouldn't yell, smack, or glare angrily at the
      offender.
      Just act as though he isn't there.
      <br> <br>
      However, some actions, like biting an electric cord, may be too risky to ignore.
      Again, yelling or hitting him won't work; instead, you should interrupt by saying "No," attract his attention, and
      then praise him when he stops and pays attention to you.
      <br> <br>
      Just say NO.
      <br> <br>
      'No' is the one word you most want your puppy to learn.
      When your puppy engages in potentially harmful or very damaging activity, you should stop it by saying "no"
      firmly.
      Use a low, firm tone instead than shouting. Give him lots of praise once he ceases the behavior.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>HOUSE TRAINING</b> <!--<b> makes the text bold-->
      <br> <br>
      Be ready for mishaps as you start puppy potty training, and remember to be patient and positive.
      Start by making a schedule because teaching your dog this is one of the most crucial things you can do.
      Dogs are creatures of habit, so it's a good idea to put on the schedule to let him out to relieve himself after
      meals,
      during playtime, when he wakes up from a nap, before confinement, and whenever he begins to search around for a
      place to urinate.
      Give your dog lots of praise when he does potty in the proper place. Even a snack after he leaves will inspire him
      the next time.
      Your dog will eventually learn where to go and when. Just keep in mind that not every puppy is perfect.
      You might have to clean up a few messes.
      <br> <br> <br>
      <b>SOCIALIZING YOUR DOG</b>
      <br> <br>
      Exposing your dog to as many people, places, and animals as you can is essential for socialization.
      Have you ever noticed that dogs are scared of individuals wearing gloves or bearded men?
      What about dogs that bark uncontrollably whenever they encounter another dog or are dreadful around cars?
      Socialization can help with certain personality traits, especially when the person is young.
