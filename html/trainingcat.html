  <h4> Training Your Cat </h4>

  <div class="text-page">
    <!--i used this div class for majority of my pages contents to ensure that all are at the same style -->
    <p>You must understand how your new kitten thinks and acts in order to properly train her. Can you train a cat?
      <br> <br>
      Dogs and cats are not the same. Because you are the "leader" of the pack, dogs want to please you.
      Your kitten's satisfaction will be her main focus.
      <br> <br>
      Having said that, there is no reason why you cannot train your kitten if you have enough patience and
      understanding.
      And it's crucial that you comply. If you don't teach your cat to be handled, how will you groom her or monitor her
      health?
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>The basic concepts</b>
      <br> <br>
      First of all, keep in mind that cats do not comprehend punishment.
      Positive reinforcement is far more effective than punishment.
      Sound difficult? Just keep in mind the three 'R's': respect, reinforcement, and rewards.
      <br> <br>
      Take respect, It's crucial that you act in a 'cat friendly' manner.
      For instance, did you know that cats detest being followed or that they dread loud noises or quick movements?
      <br> <br>
      Simply put, reinforcement entails repetition and consistency.
      Always use a strong but gentle no when telling your kitten not to do something, such as leaping on the kitchen
      counters.
      Always make a big deal out of her whenever she does anything you want to applaud.
      <br> <br>
      Which leads right into rewards. There are two kinds of rewards: your praise and a delicious treat.
      Your kitten is highly motivated by both of them.
      <br> <br> <br>
      <b>Preparing your kitty to be handled</b>
      <br> <br>
      The earlier you can get your kitten used to being picked up, the better as most cats dislike it.
      <br> <br>
      Many individuals unintentionally instill harmful habits in their pets.
      When they pick up their kitten, she cries, so they promptly set her back down.
      The kitten so discovers that by putting up a fight, she can have her way.
      <br> <br>
      Picking up your kitten and holding her gently but firmly if she resists is a preferable strategy.
      When she settles, congratulate her profusely before setting her down.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>Scratching</b>
      <br> <br>
      Is it possible to teach your kitten not to scratch?
      No. Kittens enjoy scratching because it is a healthy way to establish their territory and it stretches their
      muscles.
      Does this imply that you must put up with damaged furniture?
      No. Simply teach your kitten to direct her clawing in a different direction.
      <br> <br>
      Purchase a scratching post for your cat. Rough surfaces are especially alluring, so you might want to go with a
      post covered in something like rope.
      Play with your cat next to the scratching post, and when she uses it, praise her and maybe even give her a treat.
      <br> <br>
      If she does damage a piece of furniture, she will leave her fragrance on it, and cleaning it with an anti-odor
      agent can deter her from returning.
      Some folks find that covering a piece of furniture with something like polythene helps keep kittens from
      scratching slick surfaces.
      <br> <br> <br>
      <b>Prevent biting</b>
      <br> <br>
      Biting during play is typical kitten behavior.
      If your kitty bites your hand while you're playing, stop right away. Don't jerk your hand away under any
      circumstances.
      The game is now even more enjoyable as a result! Balls and toys make better prey items.
