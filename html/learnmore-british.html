        <h3>🐾 Personality 🐾</h3> <!--and here is the personality traits-->
        A British Shorthair cat makes a wonderful companion. She is calm and laid-back. The British Shorthair cat is a
        passionately devoted and affectionate creature that will cling to every member of her household.
        <br>

        Although the British Shorthair enjoys playing, she doesn't require round-the-clock care. She will locate someone
        and bring them a toy if she is in the mood to play. The British Shorthair performs well alone as well, making
        her an excellent companion for singles.
