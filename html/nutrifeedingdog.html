  <h4>Nutrition & Feeding For Dogs</h4>

  <div class="text-page">
    <!--i used this div class for majority of my pages contents to ensure that all are at the same style -->
    <p>The most important aspects as a dog owner includes proper training, socializing, and providing them with the best
      nutrients
      are three of the most crucial parts of dog ownership.

      A dog's current and future health will benefit from a nutritious, balanced diet, which also lowers the likelihood
      of behavioural problems developing.

      Contrary to what many dog owners believe, a dog's nutrition can really have a more significant impact on their
      overall quality of life.

      Did you know that the gut, as opposed to the brain, produces a significant amount of serotonin?
      This implies that a dog's level of happiness and relaxation can directly relate to the health of their microbiome.

      But learning the ins and outs of feeding can be challenging if you've never had a dog before.

      <br> <br>

      <img class="infopic5" src="../Media/food guide.jpeg">

      <br>

      To get you started, we've created a brief guide that includes a dog's nutritional chart.

      While this is an excellent place to start learning more about a dog's food,
      keep in mind that you should always ask your dog's veterinarian for personalized nutrition guidance.
      <br> <br>
      <b>What kind of nutrients does a dog need?</b> <!--<b> makes the text bold-->
      <br> <br>
      Your dog needs to eat a balanced diet that includes protein, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins,
      and minerals, all of which should be consumed alongside a constant supply of clean water.

      Dogs are omnivores, which means they can digest both plant and animal things,
      although veterinarians advise that the majority of your dog's diet should consist of meat.

      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>How much of a dog's diet should be made up of meat?</b>
      <br> <br>
      A dog's diet consists largely of meat, which, in general, should make up at least 33% or two thirds of their daily
      feed.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>Essential nutrients:</b>
      <br> <br>
      Over the years, more and more study on canine nutrition has been conducted, and it is, to put it mildly, a
      minefield.
      Where do you begin with so many possibilities, from raw to fresh feeding, wet food to kibble?

      The most important factor to take into account is making sure your dog eats a complete and balanced diet that
      contains the following crucial nutrients:
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>ü•© Protein</b>
      <br>
      One of the most crucial elements in sustaining healthy growth throughout a dog's life cycle is dietary protein.

      Protein is a terrific energy source for active puppies who haven't yet started to slow down and enter adolescence,
      therefore growing puppies need around twice as much protein as adult dogs need.

      Meat, fish, and eggs are all fantastic sources of protein for dogs. This is due to the fact that dogs typically
      find meat and fish to be the easiest foods to digest.

      Top Tip: To reduce expenses, several low-cost dog foods employ alternatives for protein. These non-animal protein
      replacements may be more difficult for dogs to digest and break down, which increases the risk of food
      intolerance.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>üêü Oil / Fat</b>
      <br>
      Healthy fats are essential in dog diet, but consuming too many unhealthy fats might cause health issues.

      The proper fats can help to maintain glowing dog coats and good skin, as well as reducing inflammation and
      promoting brain growth.

      Dogs must consume specific foods and supplements in order to obtain vital fatty acids like omega 3 and 6 oils
      because they are unable to produce them on their own.

      Low-mercury fish and fish oil, olive oil, flaxseed oil, hemp seed oil, avocado (flesh, no peel or stone), borage
      oil, and rosemary oil are excellent sources of healthful fats.

      <br> <br> <br>
      <b>ü•¶ Carbohydrates</b>
      <br>

      Healthy carbohydrates aid in providing dogs with essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

      It is advised that these carbs have a lot of fiber, which is increasingly understood to be good for a dog's
      health.

      Legumes and dog-safe fruits and veggies make excellent sources of carbohydrates.

      Although dogs shouldn't eat grains, some grains have been discovered to be an excellent source of fiber, aid in
      absorbing excess water in the colon, and act as a prebiotic for healthy intestinal bacteria.
      <br>

      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>üíäVitamins</b>
      <br>
      Like with humans, vitamins are crucial to a dog's health.

      Some dog diets don't contain enough of a dog's daily natural vitamin requirements since some food production
      processes entail cooking food at high temperatures.

      Meat, bone, seafood, organ meats, as well as vegetables and fruit (in moderation), are excellent providers of
      vitamins.

      Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and K are the key vitamins that are crucial for canines.

      üí°Top Tips: There is currently no evidence to support supplementing an older dog's diet in this way, despite the
      fact that many people think that senior dogs need a diet that contains extra vitamins and minerals.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>ü•ï Minerals</b>
      <br>
      The significance of minerals in a dog's diet must to be emphasized in all feeding manuals.

      Minerals support a variety of bodily processes and functions, including metabolism, skeletal development, muscle,
      bone, and tooth growth, among others.

      It is a good idea to look for dog food options with greater ash concentrations when comparing various dog food
      options because "ash" is the term used to assess the amount of minerals found in food.

      Puppies that are growing need to obtain enough minerals because their bodies require these nutrients for optimal
      growth at this time of life.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>üíß Water</b>
      <br>
      For dogs who are active, staying hydrated is crucial, so make sure your pet always has access to clean, fresh
      water.

      In general, experts advise that dogs should have one ounce of water per pound of body weight each day.

      Guide to feeding dogs:

      Two to three percent of your dog's body weight should be fed to them daily, divided into two or three meals.

      Remember that every dog is unique, and depending on the breed, size, age, and level of activity, some dogs may
      require more or less care.

      The health advantages of feeding your dog raw or lightly cooked fresh foods have been the subject of increasing
      research, but we understand that not every dog or pet parent will benefit from raw feeding.

      If you do choose to feed your dog kibble, make sure it is the best and highest quality you can purchase. You
      should also take the time to consider adding extra fruits and veggies, a raw egg, or even some oily salmon as a
      nutritious topping.

      The benefits of a cold-pressed and freeze-dried diet are comparable to those of a raw food diet.

      <b>Dog feeding advice:</b>
      <br> <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b> For the best possible canine nutrition, use organic fruits, vegetables, and grass-fed meats.</b>
        Pesticides not only harm our health but also that of our pets.</li>
      <br> <br>
      <li><b> Dogs are made up of their food and their food source:</b> It's crucial for dogs that cannot consume grains
        to be aware that many animals are fed on grains. So even though your dog might not be eating grains directly,
        depending on the protein source, they could still be consuming them.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li><b> Nutrition affects both physical health and behavior:</b>What you feed your dog will have an impact on how
        they behave and how they look physically. Like children, they are more likely to become hyperactive and
        experience health problems in the future if they eat a lot of junk food.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li><b> The key is variety.</b> Diet can influence how stressed, anxious, and confident your dog is. Dogs, like
        people, can become tired of eating the same thing repeatedly. A diversified diet will boost gut flora and foster
        a happier, healthier microbiome.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li><b> Treats help your dog learn and are excellent for training.</b> However, dog treats can also be made with
        junk food and empty calories and excessively processed. Look for dog-friendly natural treats and chews.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li><b> Good choices include:</b>Chicken, carrots, apples, cheese, cucumber, or freeze-dried snacks like fish
        liver (avoid with Dalmatians) or chicken are acceptable treats.</li>
      <br><br>
      <li><b>Chew </b> Yak chews, antlers, bull horns, pizzle sticks, ears, and coffee wood and anko roots are excellent
        chews for those who enjoy wood. Just remember to keep an eye on your dog while they chew.</li>
