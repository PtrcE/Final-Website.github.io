  <h4>Nutrition & Feeding For Cats</h4>

  <div class="text-page">
    <!--i used this div class for majority of my pages contents to ensure that all are at the same style -->
    <p>Feline diet is crucial for overall health. However, choosing the type of cat food that is ideal for your feline
      friend's health and wellbeing can be challenging given the wide range of nutritional alternatives, brands, and
      formulas that are readily available to customers. Unlike people and other animals (including dogs), cats have
      evolved special nutritional requirements that are only suitable for strict carnivores (all meat eaters).
      Domesticated cats' bodies have adapted to a diet high in protein and fat and low in carbohydrates, just like their
      undomesticated and significantly larger cousins. Cats in the wild rely on plants, mainly tall and short grass, to
      support their teeth and regulate their digestion. Wild cats, however, do not eat plant or vegetable stuff for
      sustenance or energy. A diet rich in animal-based proteins is the best choice for your kitty pet. Taurine is a
      nutrient that is crucial for the heart and brain health of cats and is only found in animal-based proteins. Cats
      would not eat the huge amounts of carbohydrates present in many commercially available dry and canned meals in
      their natural environment. Like other animals, cats lack the enzyme pathways needed to digest and use the
      carbohydrates in food. As a result, high-carbohydrate diets increase the risk of developing diseases including
      diabetes, obesity, and others. A considerable amount of fat is necessary in the diet of a strict carnivore like
      the cat. A carnivore will normally get the majority of its energy from fat. Fats play a role in the flavor of the
      food for cats. In addition to providing animal fat and several critical nutrients, meat-based meals meet the
      dietary and health requirements of our feline friend. A diet designed to meet the special dietary requirements of
      cats is one that is higher in animal-based proteins, lower in carbs, and moderate in fat. Water is another
      essential component of the cat's diet. Due to their desert habitat, they are less sensitive to thirst. The
      majority of their water needs are met by prey ingestion in their native habitat. Canning food enhances hydration,
      which benefits overall health, particularly urinary tract health. It is challenging to convince cats to accept or
      switch to other types of food since they have a special relationship to certain food textures. In order to
      increase the likelihood that kittens will always accept both types of food, we advise you to try feeding them a
      combination of canned and dry food during the first year of their lives.

      <b>Kitten food:</b> <!--<b> makes the text bold-->
      <br> <br>
      Kitten food is mother's milk or commercial milk replacement formula given every 2-4 hours if the kitten has been
      separated from its mother during the first month of the cat's life. Kitten food can eventually replace other meals
      in the following phases, quantities, and frequencies once this initial time is over:

      In order to encourage weaning from a bottle, orphaned kittens should be fed milk replacement formula starting at 3
      to 5 weeks of age in a shallow dish. 4-6 times a day, you can also add a moist, easily digestible diet that
      combines warm formula with premium canned or dried kitten food.

      Your kitten should be able to chew its own food by the time it is 8 to 10 weeks old. Feedings should occur three
      to four times a day, and you should provide it a diet high in protein and energy. Typically, we advise canned
      kitten food because it closely resembles the natural diet in terms of composition and consistency. But a balanced
      diet can also include a mix of canned and dry kitten food.

      Protein, calories, and lipids are all essential for supporting healthy growth and bodily function and are
      typically in abundance in cat food. A happy, growing cat needs to be fed the proper kitten food in the proper
      amounts and at the proper times throughout the day.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>Cat Food:</b>
      <br> <br>
      Even though dry cat diets are a very popular choice among cat owners, they should only be used as a last resort.
      This is due to the fact that dry foods include more carbohydrates than what we would consider ideal. Additionally,
      the choice of protein in dry food leans more toward plant-based protein than toward animal-based protein.

      Particularly in older and more inactive cats, the high quantities of carbs and plant protein might cause weight
      gain and digestive problems. However, for many busy households, dried food is the most practical and best option.
      For cats with allergies, certain medical issues, or as part of a diet that also includes canned food, certain
      high-end food companies have created speciality, prescription-formula dry cat diets.

      Wet cat food can imitate the nutritional profile of the meal that cats would pick in the wild. Since the protein
      in canned cat food is typically derived from animals, its nutritional profile that compliments a cat's¬†profile
      and¬†physiological requirements. Typically, canned cat food has a low carbohydrate level and a high water content.
      <br> <br> <br>

      <b>Senior Cat Food:</b>
      <br> <br>
      Cats start making the shift from maturity to the mature/senior stages of life starting at roughly 7 years old.
      With regard to a cat's weight, skin, joints, teeth, and internal organs, this shift results in health and
      lifestyle changes.

      There may not be a need to switch to a different formula if your cat is healthy on his present diet. Some
      manufacturers produce senior cat food that is specifically engineered to deliver components that are easier to
      digest than those included in regular adult cat feeds. Senior cats have a higher risk of developing kidney and
      digestive problems. There are diets designed especially for cats with these conditions that may help slow the
      development of these illnesses.

      Your vet can advise you on the best cat food for your senior cat by considering your lifestyle (indoor, outdoor,
      sedentary, active, etc.), current health state, and any pre-existing medical concerns.

      <b>Understanding Feline Nutritional Requirements</b>
      <br> <br>
      Like all other living things, cats need six different types of nutrients:
      <br> <br>
      <b>Water:</b> The single most crucial ingredient for maintaining healthy cells and proper physiological operation
      is water. Water is lost by cats through:

      <!--<ul> means unordered list, this creates bullet points in the webpage-->
    <ul>
      <li>Lungs</li>

      <li>Skin</li>

      <li>Urine</li>

      <li>Milk</li>

      <li>Feces</li>
    </ul>


    Cats have also evolved so that the majority of the water in their diets comes from food consumption. Because of
    this, a diet high in unprocessed proteins and water is a necessary component of excellent feline nutrition. Most
    canned cat meals are made with water content in mind and can provide up to 80% of this need for feline nutrition per
    serving.
    <br> <br> <br>
    <b>Protein: </b>
    <br> <br>
    An essential part of cat nutrition, protein is required for the upkeep and support of a cat's:

    <ul>
      <li>Muscle</li>

      <li>Bone</li>

      <li>Ligaments</li>

      <li>Tendons</li>

    </ul>

    Proteins are also found in a lot of the functional parts of a cat's body, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Plasma proteins </li>

      <li>Enzymes</li>

      <li>Hormones</li>

      <li>Neurotransmitters</li>

    </ul>

    Since some proteins, like fish and chicken, are more readily utilized by the body than other proteins, including
    plant and dairy, each protein has a unique digestibility profile. The quantity of protein remaining after the cat
    food's chemical breakdown in the body is referred to as its digestibility.

    Essential amino acids make up proteins. Carbon and nitrogen are used by the liver to create amino acids. The cat has
    special taste receptors and taste buds, and it is thought that they can taste the amino acids in their food, which
    helps them reject meals that are lower in high-quality proteins. There are 30 amino acids in all, 20 of which are
    optional or non-essential, and 10 of which are mandatory or essential. Dispensable means that anything can be safely
    removed from a diet. Therefore, a cat's diet is required to provide the 10 non-dispensable or necessary amino acids.
    Only fish, poultry, and meat that contain this feline nutrition requirement will be used in high-quality cat foods
    that adhere to a sound feline nutrition requirement.
    <br> <br> <br>

    <img class="infopic10" src="../Media/cat food guide.jpeg">

    <b>Essential Fatty Acids:</b>
    <br> <br>
    The most concentrated source of energy for any requirement in a feline's diet is provided by essential fatty acids,
    generally known as fats. In cats, fats act as a source of energy, negating the need for carbohydrates. The
    fat-soluble vitamins D, E, A, and K are found in fats.

    Linoleic and arachidonic acids, which are necessary for good health generally, are also provided by fats. The
    following signs of fat deficiency in cats will appear:

    <ul>
      <li>Slower growth</li>
      <li>Dull hair and flakes</li>
      <li>Listlessness</li>
      <li>Infection Susceptibility</li>
    </ul>

    The percentage of fat (essential fatty acids) in a high-quality cat chow will range from 20 to 40 percent of the
    daily caloric intake.
    <br> <br> <br>

    <b>Vitamins:</b>
    <br> <br>
    Vitamins are organic chemicals that can be produced by either plants or animals and are crucial parts of a cat's
    diet since they help control a number of bodily functions, such as:

    <ul>
      <li>Immunity boosting</li>
      <li>Growth and development support</li>
      <li>Enabling healthy cell and organ function</li>
    </ul>

    Vitamins come in two varieties: fat-soluble and water-soluble. Since fat-soluble vitamins are digested and can be
    stored in fat cells, they differ from the water-soluble vitamins that we previously described. They have acute
    toxicity levels as well as a more prolonged release than water-soluble vitamins. Vitamins that are water-soluble
    must dissolve in water in order for the body to use them. They must be supplied more frequently than fat-soluble
    vitamins since they cannot be stored.
    <br>
    These vitamins are water-soluble:

    <ul>
      <li>The B vitamins include Pantothenic Acid, Niacin, Pyridoxine, Riboflavin, Pantothenic Acid, and B-12</li>
      <li>Vitamin C</li>
    </ul>

    Vitamin needs are typically met naturally in a minimally processed cat food diet by using whole foods like poultry,
    pork, and fish. In dry meals, synthetic vitamins are typically added to make up for natural vitamins lost during
    processing. There is extensive evidence to support vitamin intake as a component of total feline nutritional health
    and wellness, despite the fact that there is no widely recognized vitamin intake requirement for cats.
    <br> <br> <br>
    <b>Minerals:</b>
    <br> <br>
    Minerals are inorganic substances created in soil or water and absorbed by plants or animals to maintain balance:

    <ul>
      <li>Acid-base balance</li>
      <li>Tissue structure</li>
      <li>Enzymes</li>
    </ul>


    Similar to vitamins, there is no widely acknowledged recommendation for cats' mineral intake, although a wealth of
    evidence suggests that the following minerals are necessary for good bodily function:
    <ul>
      <li>Calcium</li>
      <li>Phosphorus</li>
      <li>Sodium</li>
      <li>Potassium</li>
      <li>Magnesium</li>
      <li>Iron</li>
      <li>Copper</li>
      <li>Zinc</li>
      <li>Iodine</li>
    </ul>

    The levels of each mineral individually as well as the interactions between them have an impact on the overall
    balance of a cat's diet. For this reason, if you have any concerns about selecting cat food or adding supplements to
    cat food, we advise speaking with a veterinarian.</p>
